    <h1>Coding Challenge 2</h1>
    <h3>John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Calculate the average score for each team.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score).</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.</h3>
        </li>

    <h3>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</h3>
