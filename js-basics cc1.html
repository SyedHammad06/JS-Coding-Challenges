    <h4>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (Mass in kg and height in meter).</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Calculate both their BMI's.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? output: true).</h4>
        </li>
