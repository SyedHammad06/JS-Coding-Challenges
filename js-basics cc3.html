    <h1>Coding Challenge 3</h1>
    <h3>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.</h3>
    <h3>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</h3>
    <ol>
        <h3>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</h3>
        <li>
            <h3>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</h3>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</h3>
