    <h1>Coding Challenge 4</h1>
    <h3>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.</h3>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).</h3>
    <h3>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</h3>
