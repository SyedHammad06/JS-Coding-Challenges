    <h1>Coding Challenge 5</h1>
    <h3>Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!</h3>
<h3>
This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
</h3>
<ol>
<h3>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:</h3>
<li><h3>Create an object with an array for the bill values</h3></li>
<li><h3>Add a method to calculate the tip</h3></li>
<li><h3>This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations</h3></li>
<li><h3>As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
</h3></li>

<h3>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $475, $110, and $45.
Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).
</h3>
<li><h3>Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules</h3></li>
<li><h3>Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average).</h3></li>
<li><h3>Calculate the average tip for each family</h3></li>
<li><h3>Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average</h3></li>
</ol>
<h3>GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€</h3>
